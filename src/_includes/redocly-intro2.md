This block is added by modifying the schema and adding a `description` that references a remote markdown file, a relative link won't work.

```yaml
paths:
  "/V1/addresses/{addressId}":
    delete:
      tags:
      - addresses/{addressId}
      description:
        $ref: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdobeDocs/commerce-webapi/main/src/_includes/redocly-intro.md
      operationId: DeleteV1AddressesAddressId
```

The schemas documented here are autogenerated from an instance of Adobe Commerce with B2B. Each schema represents a specific user role (Admin, Customer, and Guest) and determines which endpoints are accessible. Use the version switcher to select an Adobe Commerce version and corresponding API.

You can also <a href="https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/rest/quick-reference/generate-local" target="_blank">generate a local API reference</a> based on your own Adobe Commerce configuration, which allows you to see API documentation for your specific Adobe Commerce modules, third-party modules, and extension attributes.
